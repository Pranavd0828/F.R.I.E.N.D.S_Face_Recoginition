Step 1: Locate a face in the picture, then find the location of each facial feature.

Step 2: Use the position of the facial features to align the face to match a standard template. 

Step 3: Use a neural network to create a set of measurements that represent that face. These measurements are also called a face encoding. 

Step 4: Check Euclidean distance between face encodings.
